# Planning Methodology — 6-Phase Feature Planning

This skill provides the methodology for transforming feature requests into comprehensive implementation plans. It complements the `/planning` command — the command provides the execution workflow, this skill provides the knowledge framework.

## When This Skill Applies

- User asks to "plan a feature", "create an implementation plan", or "structure development work"
- A feature request needs to be broken down before implementation
- Moving from vibe planning (unstructured) to structured planning (Layer 2)

## The 6 Phases (Overview)

### Phase 1: Feature Understanding & Scoping
**Goal**: Define WHAT we're building and WHY.
- Parse requirements, create user story, define problem/solution
- Fill: Feature Description, User Story, Problem Statement, Solution Statement, Feature Metadata
- Check memory.md (if it exists) for past decisions about this feature area

### Phase 2: Codebase Intelligence (Parallel — Research Agents)
**Goal**: Understand the existing codebase patterns.
- If custom research agents exist: Launch 3-5 parallel research-codebase agents (claude-zai) with focused queries
- If no custom agents: Launch single Explore agent (Haiku) for file discovery and pattern extraction
- Find similar implementations, map integration points, extract project patterns
- Fill: Relevant Codebase Files (with line numbers), New Files to Create, Patterns to Follow

### Phase 3: External Research (Parallel — Research Agents)
**Goal**: Gather external documentation and best practices.
- If custom research agents exist: Launch 3-5 parallel research-external agents (claude-zai) with focused queries
- If no custom agents: Launch single general-purpose agent (Sonnet)
- Find library docs, best practices, version compatibility, gotchas
- If Archon RAG available: search curated knowledge base FIRST (2-5 keyword queries)
- Fill: Relevant Documentation, Related Memories

### Phase 3b: Research Validation
**Goal**: Verify all research before building the plan on it.
- Cross-check code patterns still exist, library versions are current, file references are accurate
- Flag contradictions between research sources
- No plan section should be built on unverified research

### Phase 4: Strategic Design & Synthesis
**Goal**: Design the implementation approach.
- Synthesize validated research from Phases 2, 3, and 3b
- Design implementation phases: Foundation → Core → Integration → Testing
- Plan testing strategy (unit, integration, edge cases)
- Define measurable acceptance criteria
- Fill: Implementation Plan, Testing Strategy, Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 5: Step-by-Step Task Generation
**Goal**: Create atomic, executable tasks.
- Break Phase 4 design into atomic tasks ordered by dependency
- Every task MUST include all 7 fields:
  - **ACTION**: CREATE / UPDATE / ADD / REMOVE / REFACTOR / MIRROR
  - **TARGET**: Specific file path
  - **IMPLEMENT**: Code-level detail
  - **PATTERN**: Reference to codebase pattern (file:line)
  - **IMPORTS**: Exact imports needed
  - **GOTCHA**: Known pitfalls
  - **VALIDATE**: Executable verification command
- Fill: STEP-BY-STEP TASKS section

### Phase 6: Quality Validation & Confidence Score
**Goal**: Compile validation commands and assess confidence.
- 5-level validation commands (syntax, types, unit tests, integration tests, manual)
- Completion checklist
- Confidence score (X/10) with strengths, uncertainties, mitigations
- Fill: Validation Commands, Completion Checklist, Notes

## Key Rules

1. **Template is the control mechanism**: All research fills specific sections of `templates/STRUCTURED-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md`. Nothing is missed because the template specifies exactly what's needed.
2. **500-700 lines**: The completed plan must be 500-700 lines. Concise but comprehensive.
3. **Parallel research**: Phases 2 and 3 run simultaneously (40-50% faster). Launch two Task agents.
4. **No code in planning**: We do NOT write code in this phase. Goal is a context-rich plan for one-pass implementation.
5. **Agent-to-agent optimization**: The plan is consumed by `/execute` in a fresh conversation. It must contain ALL information needed — patterns, file paths with line numbers, exact commands.
6. **Research validation**: Validate vibe planning research before building the structured plan on it.
7. **Archon RAG first**: If available, search Archon curated knowledge before generic web search. Keep queries SHORT (2-5 keywords).
8. **Recommended model**: Start planning sessions with `claude --model opus`. Opus's deeper reasoning produces higher-quality plans — better scoping, more thorough codebase analysis, higher confidence scores. Sonnet works for simple features.

## Output

Save to: `requests/{feature-name}-plan.md`

Use template: `templates/STRUCTURED-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md` — every section must be filled with feature-specific content, not generic placeholders.
