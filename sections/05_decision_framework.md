**Proceed autonomously when:**
- Task is clear, following established patterns, or plan is explicit

**Ask the user when:**
- Requirements ambiguous, multiple approaches, breaking changes, or business logic decisions

**NEVER use EnterPlanMode.** Use `/planning` command instead — it produces structured plans in `requests/`.
