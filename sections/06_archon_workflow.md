Archon MCP handles task management + RAG search. Load `reference/archon-workflow.md`
for `/execute`, `/planning`, or task work.

**When Archon MCP is available**, use its tools for task management and RAG search.
When unavailable, use local task tracking in plans and `memory.md` for context.
See `reference/archon-workflow.md` for availability checks and fallback patterns.
