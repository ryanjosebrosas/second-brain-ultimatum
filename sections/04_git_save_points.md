**Before implementation**, commit the plan:
```
git add requests/{feature}-plan.md && git commit -m "plan: {feature} structured plan"
```

**If implementation fails**: `git stash` → tweak plan → retry.

**NEVER include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commits.** Commits are authored solely by the user.
