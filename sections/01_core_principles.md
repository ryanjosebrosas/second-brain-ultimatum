**YAGNI** — Only implement what's needed. No premature optimization.
**KISS** — Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever abstractions.
**DRY** — Extract common patterns; balance with YAGNI.
**Limit AI Assumptions** — Be explicit in plans and prompts. Less guessing = better output.
**Always Be Priming (ABP)** — Start every session with `/prime`. Context is everything.
