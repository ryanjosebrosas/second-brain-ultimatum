When creating a structured plan, ensure these are covered:

1. **Memory** — leverage the vibe planning conversation (short-term) AND `memory.md` for persistent cross-session recall (long-term). `memory.md` is read during `/prime` and `/planning`, and updated during `/commit`.
2. **RAG** — external docs, library references, past projects
3. **Prompt Engineering** — be explicit, reduce AI assumptions
4. **Task Management** — clear step-by-step task list
