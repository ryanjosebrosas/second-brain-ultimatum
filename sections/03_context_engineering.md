Structured plans must cover 4 pillars:
1. **Memory** — vibe conversation (short-term) + `memory.md` (long-term, read at `/prime`, updated at `/commit`)
2. **RAG** — external docs, library references
3. **Prompt Engineering** — be explicit, reduce assumptions
4. **Task Management** — step-by-step task list

See `reference/piv-loop-practice.md` for methodology + examples.
