# Project Memory

> Copy this file to your project root as `memory.md`.
> - AI reads at session start (`/prime`) and during planning (`/planning`)
> - AI appends after implementation (`/commit`)
> - Human can edit anytime — it's just a markdown file
> - Keep entries concise (1-2 lines each) to minimize context token usage
