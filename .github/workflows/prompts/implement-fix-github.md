## GitHub Context

- **Repository**: $REPOSITORY
- **Issue Number**: $ISSUE_NUMBER
- **Issue Title**: $ISSUE_TITLE
- **Triggered By**: $TRIGGERED_BY
- **Branch Name**: $BRANCH_NAME

## Configuration

COMMENT_ON_ISSUE=$COMMENT_ON_ISSUE

## Issue Description

$ISSUE_BODY

## Prerequisites

- RCA document exists at: `docs/rca/issue-$ISSUE_NUMBER.md`
- Working in repository: $REPOSITORY

## Implementation Instructions

### 1. Read and Understand RCA

Read the complete RCA document:

```bash
cat docs/rca/issue-$ISSUE_NUMBER.md
```

Review:
- Root cause analysis
- Proposed fix strategy
- Files to modify
- Testing requirements
- Validation commands

Optional - view the GitHub issue for additional context:

```bash
gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER
```

### 2. Verify Current State

Before making changes:
- Confirm the issue still exists
- Check current state of affected files
- Review any recent changes to those files

### 3. Implement the Fix

Follow the "Proposed Fix" section from the RCA:

**For each file to modify:**

a. **Read the existing file**
   - Understand current implementation
   - Locate the specific code mentioned in RCA

b. **Make the fix**
   - Implement the change as described in RCA
   - Follow the fix strategy exactly
   - Maintain code style and conventions
   - Add comments if the fix is non-obvious

c. **Handle related changes**
   - Update any related code affected by the fix
   - Ensure consistency across the codebase
   - Update imports if needed

### 4. Add/Update Tests

Follow the "Testing Requirements" from RCA:

Create test cases for:
1. Verify the fix resolves the issue
2. Test edge cases related to the bug
3. Ensure no regression in related functionality
4. Test any new code paths introduced

**Test implementation:**
```python
def test_issue_$ISSUE_NUMBER_fix():
    """Test that issue #$ISSUE_NUMBER is fixed."""
    # Arrange - set up the scenario that caused the bug
    # Act - execute the code that previously failed
    # Assert - verify it now works correctly
```

### 5. Run Validation

Execute validation commands from RCA:

```bash
# Run linters
[from RCA validation commands]

# Run type checking
[from RCA validation commands]

# Run tests
[from RCA validation commands]
```

**If validation fails:**
- Fix the issues
- Re-run validation
- Don't proceed until all pass

### 6. Verify Fix

Manually verify:
- Follow reproduction steps from RCA
- Confirm issue no longer occurs
- Test edge cases
- Check for unintended side effects

### 7. Update Documentation (if needed)

- Update code comments
- Update API documentation
- Update README if user-facing
- Add notes about the fix

## GitHub Workflow Integration
